# semester-project-1 - Community Science Museum

I have made a website for Community Science Museum, a museum site for the whole family.

## Description

Community Science Museum is a family friendly science museum, also perfect for school classes to visit. This is my semester project 1 while studying front-end development.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

I have used flexbox a lot, which requires a modern browser.

## Further comments

Some design changes has been done to the desktop version. This has been a difficult decision, only based on how I felt it looked myself. There is no other reason to these changes other than me feeling that it actually looked better having more similarity between both mobile and desktop version.
